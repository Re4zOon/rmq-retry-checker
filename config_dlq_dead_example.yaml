# RabbitMQ Retry Checker Configuration Example
# This configuration demonstrates wildcard setup for the pattern:
# DLQs named: dlq.queue1, dlq.queue2, dlq.payments, etc.
# Target queues: dead.queue1, dead.queue2, dead.payments, etc.
#
# The queue name (e.g., "queue1", "payments") always remains the same
# between the DLQ and its corresponding target queue.

rabbitmq:
  host: localhost
  port: 5672
  mgmt_port: 15672  # Management API port (required for wildcard support)
  username: guest
  password: guest
  vhost: /
  use_ssl: false

queues:
  # Wildcard pattern for DLQs: dlq.* matches dlq.queue1, dlq.queue2, etc.
  dlq_name: dlq.*
  
  # Wildcard pattern for target queues: dead.* derives dead.queue1, dead.queue2, etc.
  # The asterisk (*) captures everything after 'dlq.' and substitutes it after 'dead.'
  # Example: dlq.queue1 -> the * captures 'queue1' -> dead.queue1
  target_queue: dead.*
  
  # Maximum number of retries before moving to the dead queue
  max_retry_count: 3

# Example matching:
# - dlq.queue1      -> dead.queue1
# - dlq.queue2      -> dead.queue2
# - dlq.payments    -> dead.payments
# - dlq.orders      -> dead.orders
# - dlq.inventory   -> dead.inventory
